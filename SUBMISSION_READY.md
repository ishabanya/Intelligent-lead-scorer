## 🎬 Video Recording Tips

### Setup (2 minutes before recording)
1. Start the application
2. Load http://localhost:8000
3. Have demo_data.csv ready
4. Close unnecessary tabs/windows
5. Test your microphone
6. Turn off notifications

### Recording (1:30 - 1:45 minutes)
1. **[0:00-0:10]** Introduction + show dashboard
2. **[0:10-0:30]** Problem statement + solution value
3. **[0:30-1:00]** Technical architecture + key decisions
4. **[1:00-1:20]** Live demo (analyze lead, show score)
5. **[1:20-1:30]** Results + closing

### Pro Tips
- ✅ Speak clearly and confidently
- ✅ Show, don't just tell (demonstrate features)
- ✅ Highlight business impact, not just features
